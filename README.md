This Project was designed for a Samsung Galaxy 6s as this was the only android device we had.
We did this so we could demonstrate the app working on an actual phone during the walkthrough.
Therefore, we had to make a custom emulator with specs:
-	5.1-inch display
-	1440 x 2560 Resolution
-	Android Q (API 29)

SDK Tools installed:
-	Android Auto API Simulators
-	Android Emulator
-	Android SDK Platform-Tools
-	Google Play APK Expansion library
-	Google Play Instant Development SDK
-	Google Play Licensing Library
-	Google Play services
-	Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)
